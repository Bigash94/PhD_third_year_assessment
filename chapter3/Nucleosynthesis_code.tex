\chapter{How stellar models are used in nucleosynthesis codes}

Completion = 10\%
An understanding of what needs to be written with the help of previous assessments work.

\section{The stellar model code - Modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics (MESA)}

MESA a modulated open source code used to create stellar models of any star.

\section{The nucleosynthesis code - multi-zone post processing network parallel (mppnp)}

\section{The stellar models}

Explain the background of the models and how they have been improved

\subsection{Convective boundary mixing}

The major improvement of the models, discussion of how this has happened, why? Both double f and diffusion will be discussed.

\section{Multi-zone post-processing network parallel (mppnp)}

Detailed description of post-processing and the code used

\subsection{Nucleosynthesis Improvements}

Detail reaction rate improvements over set1 extended
