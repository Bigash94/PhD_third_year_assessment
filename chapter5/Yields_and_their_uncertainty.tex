\chapter{Yields and their uncertainty}

Completion = $\sim$1\%
Awaits the completion of the project for completion.

\section{The Calculation of Stellar Yields}

How yields are calculated and how/what they are used for.

\section{Reaction rate uncertainties}

How they are derived and how they are used.

\section{How to calculate yield uncertainties}

I will answer the question, why are yield uncertainties needed?

\subsubsection{Reaction Sensitivity Study}

In essence a Monte Carlo sensitivity study can be used to calculate uncertainties. I will outline the Monte Carlo method as well as how I ran and implemented it into the uncertainty calculation.

\subsubsection{Yield Uncertainties}

The uncertainty calculation and the results, what this means.
