\chapter{Stellar models and post-processing nucleosynthesis}

Completion = 10\%
An understanding of what needs to be written with the help of previous assessments work.

\section{The stellar models}

Explain the background of the models and how they have been improved

\subsection{An introduction to Modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics (MESA)}

MESA is a modulated open source stellar evolution code used to create the stellar models used here.

\subsection{Stellar model grid}

Outline of the models used and NuGrids approach to modelling stars.

\subsection{Convective boundary mixing}

The major improvement of the models, discussion of how this has happened, why? Both IGW and diffusion will be discussed.

\subsubsection{Diffusive mixing}

Extra mixing introduced by diffusion can explain the spread in grains reading better than \acrfull{igw} mixing.

\section{Post-processing nucleosynthesis}

What is post-processing?

\subsection{An introduction to multi-zone post processing network parallel (mppnp)}

Detailed description of post-processing and the code used

\subsection{Nuclear reaction network updates}

Detail reaction rate improvements over set1 extended

\subsection{Post-processed model grid}

Outline of the model grin and data tables.
