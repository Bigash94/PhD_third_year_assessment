\chapter{Yields and their importance in galactic chemical evolution}

Completion = 15\%
A basic start with some drafted paragraphs.

\section{previous model comparisons}

What improvements were made before the addition of uncertainties

\subsection{spectroscopic observations of stars}

How do the model compare with observed stars in our galaxy

\subsection{mass-spectrometry analysis of acrfull{sic} pre-solar grains}

How do the model compare with AGB stars thought to have existed earlier in our galaxy

\subsection{Other Approaches to calculating Yields}

What others think should be done to produce the 'correct' yields
