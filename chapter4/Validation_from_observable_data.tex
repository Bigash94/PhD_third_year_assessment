\section{Spectroscopy of Stars in Our Galaxy}

Outline the comparisons with spectroscopy measurements of chemical abundances from Carbon stars and Barium Stars

\subsection{Carbon stars}

Defines Carbon Stars and illustrates the comparisons with detail description.

\subsection{Barium stars}

Defines Barium Stars and illustrates the comparisons with detail description.

\section{Pre-solar grains from Meteorites}

Outline the comparisons with laboratory measurements of chemical abundances from silicon carbide grains obtained from carboniferous meteorites.

\subsection{extra mixing}

Extra mixing introduced by diffusion can explain the spread in grains reading better than \acrfull{igw} mixing.
