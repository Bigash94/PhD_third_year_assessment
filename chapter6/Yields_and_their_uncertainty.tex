\chapter{Yield uncertainties}

Completion = $\sim$1\%
Awaits the completion of the project for completion.

I will answer the question, why are yield uncertainties needed?

\section{Monte Carlo method}

In essence a Monte Carlo sensitivity study can be used to calculate uncertainties. I will outline the Monte Carlo method as well as how I ran and implemented it into the uncertainty calculation.

\section{Nuclear reaction rate uncertainties}

How they are derived and how they are used.

\subsubsection{Yield Uncertainties and identification of key nuclear reaction rates}

The uncertainty calculation and the results, and what this means.
