Completion = 25\%

\section{What do the masses of stars mean}

Describes what the different categories of stars listed below mean.

\subsection{The lowest mass stars}

\subsection{The intermediate-mass stars}

\subsubsection{The lower intermediate mass stars}

\subsubsection{The middle intermediate mass stars}

\subsubsection{The massive intermediate mass stars}

\subsection{The massive stars}

\section{Evolutionary stages of low-mass AGB stars that MESA calculates}

Describes the evolution of low-mass stars that MESA describes,WD is the exception as it is calculated but I did not study it.

\subsection{Pre-main sequence (PMS)}

\subsection{Main sequence (MS)}

\subsection{Red giant branch (RGB)}

\subsection{Horizontal branch (HB)}

\subsection{Asymptotic giant branch (AGB)}

Outlines the heavy element production stage of low-mass stars.

\subsection{White dwarf (WD)}

\section{Heavy element production in stars}

Answers the question of how heavy elements are made in stars.

\subsection{The slow neutron capture process}

This is the production method looked at in this thesis. Details of what this is and why it happens.

\subsection{The intermediate neutron capture process}

Details the possiblity of i-process.

\subsection{The rapid neutron capture process}

Informs the reader what r-process encompasses.
